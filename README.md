## 2_stress_gene_info
> Two methods used for stress check;
> 
> Geneset_1 is stress geneset extracted from MSigDB, see .xlsx for details;
> 
> Genes_2 icluding 6 stress genes, from paper < https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33947848/ >, single gene for stress check;
> 
> I prefer Geneset_1 results.

- In the feature_plot, KRT14 serves as a positive control for expression levels, compared to the low expression of stress-related genes.
